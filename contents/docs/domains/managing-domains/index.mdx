## Domain Autoscan
Domains are automatically scanned for signs of triage by the blue team. This is done by utilising the VirusTotal API - the domain is marked as "burnt" if any of the following conditions are met:
- The domain has been analysed within the past 24 hours.
- The domain has a "suspicious" reputation from at least one vendor.
- The domain has a "malicious" reputation from at least one vendor.
- More checks coming soon...

Auto scan can be enabled or disabled by following these steps.
1. Ensure the correct project is selected within the project switcher.
2. Select "Domains" in the sidebar.
3. Locate the domain you wish to modify.
4. Click the settings "cog" within the "Health Overview" card.
5. Check or uncheck the "Auto Scan" option.
6. Select "Save" to apply the changes.
