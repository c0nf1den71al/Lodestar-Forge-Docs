## Preparing A Deployment
Before infrastructure can be added to a deployment, it must be prepared. This step performs the following actions:

- Initialises Terraform.
- Defines the default infrastructure, such as networking and SSH keys.
- Creates the underlying infrastructure using the cloud integration speified.

To prepare a deployment, simply click the "Prepare" button located within the "Deployment Status" card.

Once your deployment has been prepared, refer to the [infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure) section for next steps.
